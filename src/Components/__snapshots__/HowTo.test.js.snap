      Maxed's mission is to get voters thinking about the money spent on federal political campaigns. You'll be able to see individuals and organizations that make the maximum allowable donations to a given campaign according to federal law.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Here's how:
    </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Search for a candidate by name.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a candidate has run for more than one federal office, select which campaign you're interested in. 
      </li>
      <li>
        Campaign spending is done through campaign committees that are direclty associated with a candidate's campaign. Sometimes there are more than one. Choose one to see which individuals and Political Action Committees (PACs) are donating the maximum allowable amount to a given campaign.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Note: Individuals are limited to $2,800 per campaign, while PACs are limited to $5000 per campaign. Donations from local/district/state/national party committees are subject to higher limits.
