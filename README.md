# Maxed

This project combines React, React Router, and Redux to create a single-page web app that communicates with an external API. 

I chose to use the Federal Election Commission's OpenFEC API, which stores all federal campaign-related contributions from individuals and political action committees (PACs). In the current iteration, the app can search for any federal political candidate and display those individuals and PACs who have maxed-out their contribution limits in the current 2020 election cycle. 

## Learning Goals

- Testing all asynchronous JavaScript functionality. 
- Testing all Redux functionality, including actions, reducers, mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps. 
- Unit testing all components using Enzyme/Jest.
- Storing all necessary application data within the Redux store. 
- Ensuring all state changes are handled through Redux actions and reducers (with the exception of controlled forms).
- Dynamic routing using React Router. 
- Utilizing componentDidUpdate to allow for rendering or re-rendering components on dynamic Router paths.
